--Readme document for *author*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone elseâ€™s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

  * used 'Roboto', 'Zilla Slab Highlight'


(c) Advanced features



3. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
I took an average of 2 (maybe 2.5) hours each day. With that said, I did
not get to work on this assignment every single day. I would say it was
a rough total of 6 days.
In terms of total hours, I would say it took me at least 12 hours
because I had to rewatch lectures and refer to online resources.


4. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs)
- To see the how's, I checked out a DesignCourse video:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iUJJHEIpls&t=4074s
        * Please note I used some of the code the YouTuber showed (such as how to get rid of the bullet points
          and how to get the two elements in my header to be next to each other rather than stacking)
- To figure out the why's and background of stuff like syntax, it was
  all trial and error as well as websites like:
    https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html
    https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css


5. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
I wanted to see if I could do this assignment on my own. I realize I
should have asked for help much more. With that said, I did consult
Ivy Huang on why changes I made to my css file were not being reflected
on the browser. It turns out I had forgotten to import the css file
into the hmtl file!


6. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
No.
